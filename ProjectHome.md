FlightPath is an open-source, web-based system which lets advisors and students track their progress as they advance through their degree. Advisors may use the system to advise students into particular courses, while students may use the system to check grades, look up course descriptions, and even see how their credits would fit into other degrees offered by their school.

FlightPath is highly modular, similar to Drupal, making it easy for developers to extend its functionality.

FlightPath was originally created by The University of Louisiana at Monroe, beginning in 2006.  It has been in constant use since then and remains a fundamental aspect of the ULM student experience.
