========================

  Fixed MySQL bug when editing groups

2016-02-01
  Removed section from system.module where submissions were being temporarily stored in the session.  It wasn't being used anyway,
  and it presented a possible security issue on improperly secured servers.
  

2016-01-19
  Changed default password scheme to use new D7 inspired PHPass technique, instead of basic md5's.  Added new password.inc file, virtually identical to the
  one which ships with D7.
  

2016-01-14
  Converted the advising history tab to use the content render api, so other modules can add content to that page.
  Also made it so that past advising histories appear in a collapsible fieldset, to save space.
  

2016-01-11
  Changed course popup description to use new content render API system.
  
  Added "override_degree_hours" field to degrees and draft_degrees tables, and db_override_degree_hours in the _DegreeClass object,
  for future use.
  
  Made small tweaks to fix bugs so installation works correctly.

  Workng on var hour groups, ie, "min_hours_allowed".  Also, added in mechanism for changing the name of FlightPath to something else, if desired.
  

2016-01-05
  Beginning work on optional min hours for groups.
  

2016-01-04
