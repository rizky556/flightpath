FlightPath 5.x Changelog
========================

2017-01-03
  Added additional unsetting of SESSION vars when cache is cleared, to erase any potential problems.
  

2017-01-02
  Altered the way the renderapi handles markup, so it always gets a CSS class we can
  use later.  Also, added weights to the AdvisingScreen's display_popup_course_descroption.
  
  Made minor CSS tweaks in other places too.
  
  Minor display bug in user module, list of majors for student
  

2016-12-28
  Minor changes to System to suppress PHP warnings in one area.


2016-12-22
  Fixed a bug with substitutions, where the required courses was the same in two different
  degrees, and the substituted courses was ALSO the same.  FlightPath was applying the sub
  to the first instance of the course requirement, and not necessarily the one the user selected.
  
  Worked on an issue where when two users are working on the same student, they should only pull up
  draft changes that THEY made, not that the other user made.
  
  To guarantee draft advising sessions aren't loaded inappropriately, when a faculty user loads
  a student's advising session, the draft versions are deleted.  This is to correct a bug.
  
  Fixed display bug of student's catalog year, in what if, when it is set to the Student mode in
  the settings.
  
  Fixed SQL bug in system.install, user_roles table didn't have primary key set up correctly.
  
  More work on advising sessions-- now saves a draft duplicate any time a new student is loaded.  This
  is to fix a bug which can occur when more than one advisor is working on a student in the same
  time period.
  

2016-12-16
  Added a new feature to let What If save & load with any catalog year.  Built into the system
  are the options "Current" and "Student".
  
  
2016-12-13
  Fixed bug where zero-hour courses were not allowing repeats correctly.
  
  Added more CSS classes and options to displaying degree titles.
  

2016-11-20
  Converted FlightPath and module licenses' to GNU AGPL Version 3.0.  Generally, it is compatible
  with the previous GPLv3 license, with one addition as it pertains to servers.
  See more here: http://getflightpath.com/gnu-agpl 
   

2016-11-16
  Added ability for a "locked" directive in the student_degrees table.  It lets you lock an entire
  degree classification from editing at a time.


2016-11-14
  Added minor CSS to "Change degree options" link.


2016-11-09
  Fixed minor PHP warning which pie charts were not enabled.
  

2016-11-05
  Made varius modifications to accomodate a student with no assigned major code, or, a major code which could
  not be found in the designated catalog year.


2016-11-01
  Fixed bug where identical courses which had all been advised were not correctly
  being counted as advised/fulfilled when only one was fulfilled, and before the advising term
  was advanced.
  

2016-10-28
  Added a setting to Configure School settings, to hide advising checkmarks if the student has enrolled
  in the course they were advised for (also works for completed as well).

  Added a new permission (in Admin module section) for user to be able to Delete courses, groups, or degrees.
  Also added those checks to the deletion functions for those forms.
  
  Fixed a bug in the course_search module, which was negating any effort to NOT have course names automatically
  capitalized.
  

2016-10-24
  Added new hook: hook_flightpath_can_assign_course_to_group().  It lets custom modules decide whether or not
  to allow a course into a particular group at all.
  

2016-10-19
  Fixed bug where a course over the min hours of a group was being skipped over.
  

2016-10-16
  Fixed a bug where groups with min hours weren't correctly being limited by substitutions.


2016-10-10
  Corrected logic on the min hours in groups code.


2016-10-08
  Added default setting to stop filling courses into a group once the min hours are met.
  
  Display of min hours correctly calculated in group select with min hours after advising.
  

2016-09-29
  Fixed a bug with pie charts where it was not taking a group's min_hours into account.  Also, told it to ignore
  the "hours_required_by_type" in pie chart calculations, since a group can only be assigned to one requirement type
  at a time.
  

2016-09-28
  Fixed bug where searching for lastname, firstname broke the search. 
  

2016-09-23

  year adjust code.
  

2016-09-10
  Made various changes so that pie charts are rendered using a hook-able theme function, similar to Course Row, Footnot, etc.
  This allows outside modules to modify the pie charts.
  
  Also, the pie charts by default now list out progress for every degree the student is enrolled in.  
  

2016-08-24
  Changed system.install so that datetime field is given a real date (1970-01-01 00:00:01), not all zeros, by default.  This was
  necessary because on some MySQL configurations, zero dates are not allowed.
  
  Fixed bug in stats and batch modules, where they were not using constant names correctly (this is to make compatible with MySQL 5.7+)
  
  Made note in db errors that contain the text sql_mode= to see a documentation page regarding how to correct that.
  
  Adjusted install.php, settings.php, and _DatabaseHandler so that the db_port is its own value now.
  

2016-08-23

2016-08-20
  Added setting for default 'allow dynamic' value.
  
  Fixed bug where draft mode wasn't being selected correctly when fetching degree_id.
  
  Added more CSS class names to elements on degree edit page.

  to be combined with any other degree.
  

2016-08-04
  Fixed queries in admin (for viewing watchdog logs) to use better PDO system.
  
  Made variable_get/set respect NULL values, to ensure more effience caching and fewer db calls.

  correctly.
    

2016-08-01
  Added jQuery includes in the print template files, in case they are needed for debugging.
  
  Fixed bug in History view, where "view/print all" wasn't correctly loading advising sessions
  in sequence.

  now stored in the FlightPath.settings javascript object.
  

2016-07-23
  Switched (much of) the course search module to use render arrays, so other modules can make changes.
  
  Added "back" link from Substitute popup


2016-07-16
  Fixed bug where sometimes subs in groups were not showing hours correctly, especially for transfer credits. Was
  fixed by ensuring the "req_by_degree_id" value was always passed along.
  
  Fixed bug in subs where "split sub hours" were being incorrectly reported.  This was because the course's data string
  was not being assembled correctly.

  Fixed issue where min/max hours for a group were not being displayed correctly.

  Added new theme hook, so modules can theme group select rows, to have custom messages.


2016-07-08

  list popups as well as other areas.

  a little bit.

  style the test scores.
  

2016-05-20

  Added track descriptions to what if selection screen


2016-04-19

  outside of the allowed range.
  
 
2016-03-08
  Added new permission checks to advise.module, and new permission-- limiting ability of user to only view their

  Made various changes in an attempt to help speed up page loads.


2016-02-15

  global one).
  

2016-02-13
  Fixed bug in install script so that track major codes can have up to 20 characters.
  
  Modified the add degree form, to check to make sure tracks and major codes don't contain spaces,
  as well as fall below the 20 character limit.
  
  Fixed but which was intruduced by removing submissions form sessions.  As a result, forms which didn't
  validate didn't retain values.  Instead made it so only password fields were hidden from the session.

  and it presented a possible security issue on improperly secured servers.
  

2016-01-19

  one which ships with D7.
  

2016-01-14

2016-01-11
  Changed course popup description to use new content render API system.
  
  Added "override_degree_hours" field to degrees and draft_degrees tables, and db_override_degree_hours in the _DegreeClass object,
  for future use.
