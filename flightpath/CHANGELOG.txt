FlightPath Changelog
====================

2012-03-11
  Got many of the popups working on the "View" page.  Also, submitting a basic advising session works.
  
  Moved over all of the Javascript into its own file (advise.js) instead of being locked up inside the
  AdvisingScreen object.  It could be further split out into other files as well.
  
  Adding/Removing Substitutions, and removing courses from a degree plan, appear to be working
  correctly.
  
  Menus can specify a file to load as needed.  Like an additional .inc file where that page_callback is located.

  Admin toolbox and hide/show pie charts
  
  Got rid of XML in FlightPath.  Now, we just serialize or nothing.  No sense in the extra overhead.  Still need to get rid of it
  for module.info files.  Some are still .xml.  Will get to that when I do the Admin work. 
  

2012-03-10
  Continuing work on making FP more like Drupal.
  
  Created "modules" table to better keep track of modules.
  
  Created student_search module.  Working on bringing in all of its functionality.
  
  Added jquery 1.7.1 instead of 1.3.2.
  
  Added much of the Advise module
  
  Have a new concept of passing around the "current_student_id" from page to page,
  and saving all other "advising variables" to a table, rather than keeping them in the POST
  between every page.  This makes it much more tidy.

  ** BIG CHANGE **
  I ran a script to convert from camelCase to underscore_style.
  Now, only Class names are CamelCased.  Everything else-- variables and methods and functions,
  are all going to be underscore_style (also called K&R or C++ style).
  Even though I think this isn't as pretty, it is consistent, which is what I am more
  concerned about.
  
  Fixed numerous capitalization problems.  I'm sure there's more after this.
  
  Gave important system_settings default values.
  
  Moved functions.php into other .inc files, in a new "includes" directory.


2012-03-08
  Fixed a bug where definitions in groups, once entered could not be removed.
  
  Adjusted default.settings.php file to have error reporting limited by default,
  as well as additional instructions for setting up through Windows.
  
  Added "user_auth" table to flightpath database.  Implemented default login
  attempts to that table (empty it to override and use another method)
   - Created "admin" user by default.  user_id = 1, password = fpadminuser
   
  Made it so the number of courses to load (and cache) on login is configurable
  in the settings.
  
  Added menu_rebuild_cache(), pretty_print(), and db_query()
  
  Making other numerous changes, to make FlightPath more like Drupal.
  
  Changing naming convention to underscore style instead of camelCase,
  when not dealing with an object.
  
  Made a lot of progress in getting the primary display of course_search module
  to use the new menu system (piped through ?q=location/etc

--- v3.1.1

2012-01-03
  Cleaned up queries in admin.php to use new replacement pattern system.

2011-12-22
  Modified queries throughout the various classes and php files to 
  use new replacement pattern system, to make them less
  vulnerable to SQL-injection attacks.

2011-11-25
  Created new replacement pattern system for DatabaseHandler::dbQuery function,
  to help protect against SQL-injection attacks.

--- v3.1

7-14-2011
  FlightPath is now capable of handling courses with 0 hours.
  It actually, internally, tracks them as 1 hour courses, but
  displays them as 0 hour courses.  The pseudo-hour which is 
  attributed to it is known as a "Ghost hour" in the system.

5-4-2011
  Fixed a small bug relating to degree options.  If a student
  has a particular option selected, then changes catalog years,
  and that option (track code) no longer exists, then FP was just
  display no degree plan.  It will now default back to the
  base degree plan.


--- v3.0.1b

4-11-2011
  Made "deCanSwitchUsers" be its own permission, instead
  of simply testing for full_admin status.
  
  Made theme change to remove "ULM" from the default banner image.

--- v3.0b ---

4-8-2011
  This is the initial release of FlightPath as open source,
  debuting as version 3.0b.
