7-14-2011
FlightPath is now capable of handling courses with 0 hours.
It actually, internally, tracks them as 1 hour courses, but
displays them as 0 hour courses.  The pseudo-hour which is 
attributed to it is known as a "Ghost hour" in the system.

5-4-2011
Fixed a small bug relating to degree options.  If a student
has a particular option selected, then changes catalog years,
and that option (track code) no longer exists, then FP was just
display no degree plan.  It will now default back to the
base degree plan.
