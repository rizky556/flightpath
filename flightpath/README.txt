A brief history...
----------------------

FlightPath was created by the University of Louisiana at Monroe
(http://www.ulm.edu) in 2006, and has been in continuous use
ever since.

The decision to release the code as open source occured in 2011.

While the project is now contributed to by a community of developers,
the original ULM development team were as follows:

Richard Peacock - Primary developer
Joe Mansour - Mainframe/Banner coordinator
Joann Perrer - Degree and course data coordinator

The "classic" theme was created by Paul Gullette, with the
original banner graphic designed by Rob Glaze.
